Waldiez Runner provides a set of HTTP endpoints to manage, run, and interact with tasks.
All routes are under the **`/api/v1/tasks`** path and require a valid JWT token with a ***`tasks-api`*** audience.

!!! info "Admin Capabilities"
    Users with admin privileges can access and manage tasks from any client, not just their own. Regular users can only access their own tasks.

## üìÑ List All Tasks

***GET /api/v1/tasks***

Returns a paginated list of all tasks for the current client.

***Query Parameters (optional, for pagination)***

- `page` (default: 1)
- `size` (default: 50)

Response: `Page[TaskResponse]`

## List All Tasks (Admin Only)

***GET /api/v1/admin/tasks***

Returns a paginated list of all tasks from all clients. Requires a valid JWT token with an ***`admin-api`*** audience.

***Query Parameters (optional)***

- `page` (default: 1)
- `size` (default: 50)
- `search`: Search term to filter tasks by filename or status
- `order_by`: Field to sort by (`id`, `flow_id`, `filename`, `status`)
- `order_type`: Sort order (`asc` or `desc`, default: `desc`)

Response: `Page[TaskResponse]`

!!! warning
    This endpoint requires admin privileges and will return tasks from all clients in the system.

## üì• Create a New Task

***POST /api/v1/tasks***

Uploads a `.waldiez` flow and creates a new task. Limited to 3 concurrent tasks per client.

***Form Data:***

- `file`: The `.waldiez` file (required)
- `input_timeout`: Timeout for input requests (default: 180 seconds)

***Response***: `TaskResponse`

***Error***: `429` if the task limit is exceeded.

### Permission Check

Before creating a task, the system performs a permission verification by sending a GET request to a configurable external endpoint. This check ensures the user has permission to run tasks.

**Request Details:**
- **URL**: Configured via `TASK_PERMISSION_VERIFY_URL` environment variable
- **Parameters**: `user_id` (extracted from JWT token)
- **Headers**: `X-Runner-Secret-Key` (configured via `TASK_PERMISSION_SECRET`)

**Expected Response:**
- **200 OK** with `{"can_run": true}` if permission is granted
- **429 Too Many Requests** with `{"can_run": false, "reason": "custom reason"}` if permission is denied

**Error Handling:**
- If permission is denied (429), the API returns `429` with the reason from the response
- If the permission check fails (network error, invalid response), the API returns `500`
- Permission check is skipped if external auth is disabled or not configured

This feature allows integration with external authorization systems to control task execution based on user permissions, quotas, or other business logic.
